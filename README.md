# Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning repository! This repository showcases several Jupyter notebooks covering various deep learning concepts, including regression, classification, natural language processing (NLP), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and more. It represents my  work and dedication in the field of machine learning and deep learning.
Introduction

Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field that aims to develop algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. This repository focuses on deep learning, a subfield of machine learning that deals with artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain.

The notebooks in this repository cover a wide range of topics, including:

    Regression: Predicting continuous values.
    Classification: Assigning labels to input data.
    Natural Language Processing (NLP): Analyzing and processing text data.
    Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Modeling sequential data.
    Fine-tuning Neural Networks: Optimizing pre-trained models for specific tasks.
